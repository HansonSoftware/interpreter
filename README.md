# Interpreter

This project meant to house my code from reading _"Writing an Interpreter in Go"_ by Thorsten Ball, and my notes on the core components of tree-walking interpreters.

## Goals:

- Better understand interpreters
- Better understand interpreted languages
- Learn more about Go
- Become a better programmer
- Maintain a very clean git repository using conventional commits
- Follow this book to the end
- Implement my own features on top of the base interpreter from the book
